Deadlock means thread is waiting for another thread to finish 
before it can acquires its mutex

see: http://www.technical-recipes.com/2015/creating-and-avoiding-deadlock-conditions-in-c/http://www.bogotobogo.com/cplusplus/multithreaded4_cplusplus11B.php

If thread A is executing and isnâ€™t holding mutex lock 1 yet and 
thread B acquires mutex lock 2, neither of the threads can 
continue past the second lock acquisition
