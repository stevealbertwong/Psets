??
join => the time it takes to create a new thread, the main thread is most likely to finish ahead of our child thread
thread pool => reduce overhead
blocked state on threads

t.detach() => daemon process
synchronization mechanism => makes threads running deterministic

c++ => automatically passed by value i.e. copy a new value into the function stack
c default's pass by reference i.e. all threads share the same resource
