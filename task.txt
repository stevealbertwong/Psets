little vs big endian to order the byte within a word, IA32 vs x86
big -> most significant byte has lower address i.e. highest order digit 1 in 0x123456 has lowest address
little -> least significant byte has lower address x86-> little endian 
pointer is a data object that contains an address that you intepret as an address 
boolean in theory is 1 bit but in pratice we address data in 1 byte

BFS, DFS, Dijkstra's algo -4pts

DFS - Discovery guarantee to find a path if one exists + D if you apply it since only bactrace
- mark visited, for loop for neighbour node, if stuck backtrace.
Do Fuckup Shit

BFS - cooler than DFS as it will always find the shortest possible path + implementing queue is harder than backtrace, keep track of path by storing predecessor for each vertex, use up more memory assign2 word letter, breadcrump-> breadth = tried every shortest path
- queue, mark visited + set n's previous to be v (breadcrumb), for loop for neighbour node + enqueue, dequeue
Being Fucking Smart

Dijkstra's algo - Cooler than B cause you get a Turing Award, minimum weight path of graph -> create a table of information about currrently known best way to reach each vertex
mark visited + pqueue + weight

going through all the nodes, keep updating the shortest path to the nodes, if you are in the queue then you are waiting for updates on your minimum cost, if you are dequeued then it is confirmed that it is your minimum cost , if you are enqueue then it is the first time you are considered for minimum cost

priotiy queue can guarantee it is the shortest path when you dequeue for 2 reasons: 
1. the first node in the pqueue is guaranteed to be the shortest path to that node as all other indirect paths have at least higher cost 
2. it guarantees it updates the shortest path before dequeuing it as it consider all other shortest paths including its indirect path before considering dequeuing it

prime example of greedy algo

EVERYTHING NORMALIZE BECOME PROBABILITY
WHAT and WHY PGM - conceptual intuition
FRONTEND of probability + independent of algo i.e. you wont learn any algo + modeling a world of uncertainties   

PGM - model, graphical models, random variables that represents probabilities, bayesian network-> directed graph


PGM is a framework -> very large amount of variables + significantly uncertain about the right answer to the result

Model-> declaration representation of understanding of the world, representation of computer that captures our understanding the world in terms of variables and their relationship

Think of the world as a large amount of random variables -> model relationship with joint distribution over possible assignment of certain random variables

Joint distribution: P(x_1, x_2, .... x_n) -> huge possible states, intrinsically exponentially large, ALSO think of it as a table e.g. intelligence, difficulty, grades -> probailitity of every combinations of these 3 random varaibles 

Independent parameter -> values are not determined by other parameters

Conditioning/observing assignment of Grade A -> eliminate all possible assignments of Grade B/C + normalizing/rebase aka reduced probability distribution

Marginalize -> getting rid of intelligence just sum up according to distribution over 

Factor -> a function or a table (x_1, x_2, ...x_n) take all possible assignments in cross-product space i.e. all possible combination of assignments -> gives a real value for each combination 
e.g. joint distribution is a factor a table fo random varaibles
e.g. CPD is a factor
Scope of the factors -> (x_1, x_2, ... x_n) i.e. arguments the factors takes

Factor product -> conditional probability
Factor maginalization -> same
Factor reduction -> same delete + renormalize

- differnet connector depending on your particular kind of database e.g. mysql connector
- API for connecting to remote database in java code
- directly querying database in java from android device
- skip setting up server
- server is a web layer between client and db: client makes queries by contacting certain specific URLs, server code send appropriate data back 
- return a cursor object
	// load JDBC driver and connect to the server
	String url = "jbdc:mysql://server:port/databaseName";
	Connection connection = DriverManager.getConnection(url, username, password);

Wigets and layout and Text Fields and Container

Layout  
- layout:alignParentLeft / alignLeft=textView margin = 35dp / centerHorizontal  
- below=textView margin=140dp / alignTop=textView / alignBottom=textView (overlap the text view) / centerVertical

Event
- Properties -> onClick identifer -> puts the name of the method 

ImageView
ListView
GridView
RadioGroup
layout_alignParentX
layout_marginX
RelativeLayout

Activity - fundamental units of GUI, a single screen of UI
View - item that appears on screen in an activity e.g. wigets and layout
Wigets - button, text view
Event - click, timer, network data available

	
7-1
layout managers- rules that decide how to position each layout
Layout = ViewGroup = Layout manager = containers of view = Activity
- described in XML mirrored in Java code 
- nested layout/custom layout -> combinations of features
- inside each layout is wigets, attributes

Element(tag), attribute(additional info about the tag), value

<course name="CS193A" instructor="marty>

layout_margin
gridlayout - layout widget in lines of row and columns e.g. calculator app RARELY USED

relativelayout 
- each widget position relative to each other, you describe position of wiget relative to other wigets

linear layout
- layout wigets/views in a single line
- does not wrap around, falls off the screen if reach the edge of screen

xml is extensible html, you could make up any tags as you want <pizza>

gravity
- alignment direction widgets are pulled
- alignment in linear layout is called gravity
- any stuff inside me move to the other side -> button: layout_gravity="right"

weight
- size of the wigets, fraction of overall screen
- 1 out of 1 of all the space thats left, competing with the remaining space with widgets with layout_weight="1"

padding
- padding makes the widget bigger
- get the button a little bigger stretching it out
- after setting the layout width and height to "match_parent" or "wrap_content" or "100dp"
- dp: device pixel, dip: device independent pixel, sp: scaling pixel
- match_parent: same size as the layout containers the widget is inside

margin
- outside of the widget, extra space outside to separate it from others

tablelayout same as gridlayout

APPLICATION
Composite/nested layout
- LinearLayout 
layout_gravity: refers to the gravity of LinearLayout to its parent
gravity: refers to its sub-widgets' gravity
WHICH MEANS -> layout gravity:center = button layout_gravity:center

Android Manifest.xml
<action android:name="android.intent.action.MAIN" /> -> this is the app's entry point
CATEGORY_LAUNCHER means it should appear in the Launcher as a top-level application, while CATEGORY_ALTERNATIVE means it should be included in a list of alternative actions the user can perform on a piece of data. -> entry point should be listed in the application launcher + Android does not grab whichever one appears first in the manifest but it starts with activity having CATEGORY_LAUNCHER + CATEGORY_LAUNCHER : The activity can be the initial activity of a task and is listed in the top-level application launcher.

LoginActivity -> MainActivity

2 ways to load screen from Activity.java:

1. Activity
setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);

2. Fragment
View rootView = inflater.inflate(R.layout.fragment_shopping_lists, container, false); // load GUI layout from XML
initializeScreen(rootView); // mListView = (ListView) rootView.findViewById(R.id.list_view_active_lists);

Move xml into a new fragment -> then linear layout contain the new fragment in the original xml

hypothesis(x) = theta0 + theta1*x -2pts
to find theta0 and theta1 -> you need to minimize cost function by derivatives and lest square method
J(theta0, theta1) = 1/2m sum(h(x)-y)^2 where square to ensure positivity, division by 2 easy to calculate
cost function J(theta0, theta1) calculates the difference between h(x) vs y for each theta0 and theta1
transition from graph h(x) to J(theta) 
J(theta) x axis is theta + it is convex since the difference between h(x) and y increases quadrically when slope theta increases
gradient descent: core idea is differentiate J(theta) and theta to the their rate of change -> 1. if it is big, then means slope or theta is big so much deduction 2. determine positive and negative so that it knows which way to go to reach minimum of J(theta)

First ask: what is the probability of getting head out of 1 toss
Then ask: now how about probability of getting heads out of 6 tosses
now you are stuck so you invent Random Variable, Expectation and Variance

Nosql vs sql intuition -1pt
nosql store data in memory using primative data strucutre whereas sql has a preset schema that is like a struct. When you install mysql it is like a C program that have preset methods allocate memory. Then when you CREATE TABLE students(first_name VARCHAR(30) NOT NULL, student_id INT UNSIGNED NOT NULL AUTOINCREMENT PRIMARY KEY); it creates a huge struct and if data did not get written into certain table it is wasted. It is like pre-announcing 1000k of memory stick together since they are all related and relevant to my search. i.e. very likely my search is going to need all these memory data together. However for data of very different types and complicated structures no or a customable schema is more suitable.

Tutorial on hashing for look up 
Hashing into array uses key itself as an address into the data structure, convert key into address through integer key -> guarantee O(1) -> whereas BST due to its comparison tree data structure -> guarantee O(logN) for searching

The idea for hashing is that it is super easy for searching and look up -> but no concept for add and delete + clash of address collision + convert string into table address

Applications:
Compiler, a hash table will likely be used for keyword and identifier storage because a compiler needs quick access to this information + optimizing switch statements 
// what is keyword and identifier storage???

Implementation of a cache, and many web browsers and operating systems will use a hash table for just that.

Cryptography, where algorithms that are geared more toward security are used to create digital fingerpints for authentication and data integrity.

The quality of hashing depends on probability it generates
e.g. add-shift-xor produces 2^11*n combination where n is number of char in string
Normal 8 passwords combination produces 88^8 --> e15 combination
e15: shift to the left 15 digits or 1 times 10 to the power of 15

see: https://www.lamission.edu/learningcenter/docs/mathlab/Symbols_Notations/what%20does%20E%20mean%20on%20a%20calculator.pdf

bool OurHashMap::containsValue(string key){
	int bucketIndex = hashMap(key) % numBuckets;
	// forloop run through the bucket 
};

Behind MongoDB is a giant hash algorithm 
nosql they just hash data into a memory address and therefore super quick look up but the data stored in each bucket /cell related to each other in meaningless way and so unless one defines data schema beforehand we could not get relational or query feature

Distributed evenly: shifting bits and xor operations does not create a pattern + hit every numbers after hash

file system
it is like creating file objects with meta data of memory address, directories and files it contains

path 
when you cd the path, you are traversing the nodes of memory addresses

io
50% system crashes come from device drivers

memory mapped i/o
maps each device's control registers to a range of physical address on memory bus, meaning reading and writing memory by CPU does not go to main memory but directly to registers on I/O devices' controller

clock algorithm
requesting pages when memory is low

kernel

2. if its is file -> then inode contains block of memory of its content

in logistic regression, gradient descent is decreasing partial derivative of cost BUT NOT the cost itself. for a linear classifier, the fact that it is in +ve or -ve area affects gradient decsnet despite the absolute value of cost being the same. i.e. if in the +ve area, as theta increase the cost increase exponestially so cost is +ve while if in -ve area, as theta increase cost decrease so cost is negative -> -ve add theta, +ve minus theta
